AP Computer Science Project
The task was to load a file of attendees and seat them at tables. I needed methods for checking that the attendees don't go over 100, the max number of attendees from one company is 10, a table doesn't have more than 10 seats, registering new attendees, find an attendee by name, printing rosters by table, and printing rosters by company. My project completes all the task's objectives.
